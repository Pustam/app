# Markdown Notes

> Thanks for your interest. I've given up development of Pustam / Markdown Notes in favor of [Joplin](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin) which already does a lot of the things that I intended for this application to do and much much more. I would like to help the developer of Joplin rather than duplicate the effort here. If you are looking for a Note taking app, I'd recommend taking Joplin for a spin.

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/markdown-note/markdown-notes/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/markdown-note/markdown-notes)

A note taking application built around Markdown intended to be keyboard friendly.

The project is currently **not under development** and targeted at Linux x64 architecture but should not have any problems running on a Windows machine.
